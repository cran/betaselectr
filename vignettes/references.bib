	abstract = {This article reviews six alternative approaches to constructing standardized logistic regression coefficients. The least attractive of the options is the one currently most readily available in logistic regression software, the unstandardized coefficient divided by its standard error (which is actually the normal distribution version of the Wald statistic). One alternative has the advantage of simplicity, while a slightly more complex alternative most closely parallels the standardized coefficient in ordinary least squares regression, in the sense of being based on variance in the dependent variable and the predictors. The sixth alternative, based on information theory, may be the best from a conceptual standpoint, but unless and until appropriate algorithms are constructed to simplify its calculation, its use is limited to relatively simple logistic regression models in practical application.},

Using the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew F. Hayes carefully explains procedures for testing hypotheses about the conditions under and the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, as well as the moderation of such mechanisms. Hayes shows how to estimate and interpret direct, indirect, and conditional effects; probe and visualize interactions; test questions about moderated mediation; and report different types of analyses. Data for all the examples are available on the companion website ([ital]www.afhayes.com[/ital]), along with links to download PROCESS"--},

We propose that this approach might not be best for forming confidence intervals for quantities with sampling distributions that are slow to approach normality, or for functions of model parameters. We implement and study a robust analog to likelihood-based confidence intervals based on inverting the robust chi-square difference test of Satorra (2000). We compare robust standard errors and the robust likelihood-based approach versus resampling methods in confirmatory factor analysis (Studies 1 \& 2) and mediation analysis models (Study 3) for both single parameters and functions of model parameters, and under a variety of nonnormal data generation conditions. The percentile bootstrap emerged as the method with the best calibrated coverage rates and should be preferred if resampling is possible, followed ...},

	abstract = {With fixed predictors, the standard method (Cohen, Cohen, West, \& Aiken, 2003, p. 86; Harris, 2001, p. 80; Hays, 1994, p. 709) for computing confidence intervals (CIs) for standardized regression coefficients fails to account for the sampling variability of the criterion standard deviation. With random predictors, this method also fails to account for the sampling variability of the predictor standard deviations. Nevertheless, under some conditions the standard method will produce CIs with accurate coverage rates. To delineate these conditions, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compute empirical CI coverage rates in samples drawn from 36 populations with a wide range of data characteristics. We also computed the empirical CI coverage rates for 4 alternative methods that have been discussed in the literature: noncentrality interval estimation, the delta method, the percentile bootstrap, and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap. Our results showed that for many data-parameter configurations—for example, sample size, predictor correlations, coefficient of determination (R2), orientation of ␤ with respect to the eigenvectors of the predictor correlation matrix, RX—the standard method produced coverage rates that were close to their expected values. However, when population R2 was large and when ␤ approached the last eigenvector of RX, then the standard method coverage rates were frequently below the nominal rate (sometimes by a considerable amount). In these conditions, the delta method and the 2 bootstrap procedures were consistently accurate. Results using noncentrality interval estimation were inconsistent. In light of these findings, we recommend that researchers use the delta method to evaluate the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.},
