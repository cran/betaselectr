Description: It computes betas-select, coefficients after standardization in
  structural equation models and regression models, standardizing only selected
  variables. Supports models with moderation, with product terms formed after
  standardization. It also offers confidence intervals that account for
  standardization, including bootstrap confidence intervals as proposed by
  Cheung et al. (2022) <doi:10.1037/hea0001188>.
